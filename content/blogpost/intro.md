### TODOS (In no particular order)
 * I want the ability to have footnotes which appear as hovers on desktop, but as jump-tos on mobile with jumpback links.
 * I want a nice centered blog style which is very responsive
 * I want nice header images
 * I want side-bar descriptions of inline images
 * I want better handling of code blocks
  * Nice background and full width blocks at the very least
  * Syntax highlighting

### TODOS for Hugoadmin
  I'm developing a companion app in Go, which I'm provisionally calling `hugoadmin`
  the goal of this tool is to help rapidly create Hugo-compatible folder layouts.

  * ~~Write a `createproject` command to lay out the basic skeleton of a site.~~
  * ~~Write a `createtype` command to insert a new content type into an existing site.~~
  * Come up with more features as I find a need for them
