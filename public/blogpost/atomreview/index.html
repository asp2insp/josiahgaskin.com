		<h2 class="subtitle">A collection of thoughts on GitHub&#39;s new editor</h2>
		<h3>First Impressions</h3>

<p>So far so good. I&rsquo;ve been working on my website using my hot-off-the-press copy
of Atom for the past 30 minutes and I&rsquo;m enjoying myself thus far.</p>

<h3>Likes</h3>

<ul>
<li><code>cmd-P</code> opens files and <code>cmd-shift-p</code> opens the command palette. This is great
since I&rsquo;m coming from using SublimeText as my primary editor. (This was one
reason I could never make myself enjoy using LightTable). I feel familiarity
right off the bat here.</li>
<li>Dark theme by default. Very nice and easy on the eyes (except for the font,
more on that below).</li>
<li>Git modified markers on the left gutter. Very helpful and much less distracting
than the ones in IntelliJ IDEA. (In IDEA the modification annotations share
 a gutter with the syntax error markers).

<ul>
<li>As a subpoint, the folder coloring is ridiculous. Looks like Christmas in March:</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

</p>

<h3>Dislikes</h3>

<ul>
<li>The default text size is gargantuan. Like monstrous.</li>
<li>The default font color is very low-contrast for Markdown standard text.</li>

<li><p>The indentation logic is not quite as intuitive as ST. Hard to put my finger
on it, but it&rsquo;s definitely inferior.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ah, got an example. Define a CSS rule, enter the {} and then hit return.
Rather than creating:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code class="CSS">h1 {
}
</code></pre>

<p>Atom does this:</p>

<pre><code class="CSS">h1 {
|}
</code></pre>

<p>(imagine the pipe is your final cursor position)</p></li>

<li><p>No auto-suggest for CSS attributes.</p></li>
</ul>
