		<h3>TODOS (In no particular order)</h3>

<ul>
<li>I want the ability to have footnotes which appear as hovers on desktop, but as jump-tos on mobile with jumpback links.</li>
<li>I want a nice centered blog style which is very responsive</li>
<li>I want nice header images</li>
<li>I want side-bar descriptions of inline images</li>
<li>I want better handling of code blocks

<ul>
<li>Nice background and full width blocks at the very least</li>
<li>Syntax highlighting</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>TODOS for Hugoadmin</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;m developing a companion app in Go, which I&rsquo;m provisionally calling <code>hugoadmin</code>
  the goal of this tool is to help rapidly create Hugo-compatible folder layouts.</p>

<ul>
<li><del>Write a <code>createproject</code> command to lay out the basic skeleton of a site.</del></li>
<li><del>Write a <code>createtype</code> command to insert a new content type into an existing site.</del></li>
<li>Come up with more features as I find a need for them</li>
</ul>
